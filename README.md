# Research Portfolio - Samruddhi Rahate
## About Me

I'm an Electronics and Communication Engineering undergraduate at IIIT Surat with a strong focus on secure AI systems, machine learning, and systems research. My research interests lie at the intersection of security, AI infrastructure, and formal verification.

**Current Status:** B.Tech Student (2023-2027) | Research Enthusiast | Open Source Contributor

## Research Interests

- Secure AI Inference Systems
- Formal Verification & Microkernel Security
- Machine Learning Infrastructure
- AI Safety & Model Security
- Systems Programming (Rust, C/C++)

## Research Experience

### SPAR International Research Fellowship
**Research Intern** 

**Project: SL5-Aligned Secure AI Inference Stack**

Developed a formally verified secure AI inference system addressing critical vulnerabilities in GPU-based ML deployment:

- **Security Innovation:** Designed and implemented a secure AI inference stack using seL4 microkernel with Buildroot Linux, achieving 60% reduction in compiled code (down to 1.1M LOC) and reducing attack surface from 10+ exposed services to just 1
  
- **Model Protection:** Created a novel Weight Enclave architecture using Candle (Rust) and llama.cpp with bandwidth-limited egress throttling (1-5 KB/s), making unauthorized exfiltration of 10GB+ models require months and multi-TB models require decades to century+

- **Validation:** Conducted comprehensive exfiltration experiments to validate security guarantees and demonstrate practical effectiveness of the proposed architecture

**Key Technologies:** seL4 microkernel, Rust, Candle, llama.cpp, Buildroot Linux, Formal Verification

**Impact:** Demonstrated feasible approach to deploying large language models in security-critical environments while maintaining practical performance characteristics
